## Hi there, welcome to [buildsquad](https://www.buildsquad.net/) 👋

In order for web3 to mature for wider adoption, considerable development, improvement, and innovation must take place in two main areas: user experience and developer experience. **We are committed to advance both areas and are dedicating our expertise to contribute components throughout the web3 developer stack**, mainly:
- Application Enablement
- Developer Tools
- Infrastructure
- Protocols

Please [get in touch](https://www.buildsquad.net/#contact-us), if you:
- Have a great idea/open source project but don’t have the resources or a team to develop it further.
- Are an ambitious developer who shares our vision.
- Want to build a new and improved world with us. Alternatively: Wanna unlock a new dimension with us.
- Want to discuss ideas with like-minded folks from all around the globe.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**
